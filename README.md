## I've created a beautiful and functional employee management system with the following features:

### Authentication:

- Login form with username/password validation
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Default credentials: username: "admin", password: "admin123"

### Employee Management:

- List view with all employee details
- Create new employee records
- Edit existing employee information
- Delete employee records
- Form validation for all fields

### Modern UI:

- Clean and professional design
- Responsive layout
- Gradient backgrounds
- Interactive hover states
- Lucide icons for better visual hierarchy

### State Management:

- Zustand for efficient state management
- Separate stores for authentication and employee data
- Type-safe with TypeScript

### Routing:

- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Clean URL structure
- Automatic redirects
- The development server is now running.
